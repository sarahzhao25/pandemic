GAME START
As a user playing the game ...
- the game appears set.
- I will watch amazing animations of 18 disease cubes and the cards
  - it's like watching Hearts get set up
- you can see everyone's cards  (Everyone's cards are set up for them)
- the first person's turn is automatically decided

As GAME PROGRESSES:
Fake play -> visualize the strategy => don't let them actually do something wrong/tell them it's wrong.
It won't be solid until the last play is performed: "Are you sure you want to do this?"
- If it's illegal, we have to let them know that they cannot perform an action.
