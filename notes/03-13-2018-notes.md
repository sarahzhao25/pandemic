Other user stories and possible issues:
- Creating the board possibly using leaflet.js or other.
- Using firebase? Worth the research?
-

Something to note:
Jackbox.tv -> if you are disconnected, your character does not delete from the board. But if you reconnect, there is a possibility that one of them will error, but it's also possible that you come right back as that character. How does sockets alone handle that without login?

As a current player:
- all options that are AVAILABLE should become available on player turn, and all other options should be left hidden/blacked out.

Something to consider:
- the game logic behind outbreaks, and behind the moves between infecting/etc, => when to use the event cards.
- should a modal pop up that asks if you want to use your event card at that time? or should it be time-based?
